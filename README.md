# Impact_Overweight_Obesity


According to data from the *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention* [@CDC] obesity affected more than 2 in five adults in 2019. Additionally, nearly one in three adults were overweight. In 2019 dollars, the estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the United States was nearly 173 billion USD. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has risen dramatically over the past few decades, reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. According to a recent article by the World Health Organization, the worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1990 and 2020.
This alarming trend has prompted widespread concern among policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers [@WHO2024].  
While numerous studies have examined the health consequences of overweight and obesity, relatively few have comprehensively assessed their economic implications.


The prevalence of overweight and obesity has emerged as a pressing public health issue with far-reaching implications for global health and well-being. Despite extensive research and public health interventions, the economic ramifications of overweight and obesity remain inadequately understood on a global level, presenting a significant gap in current literature. This thesis seeks to address this research gap by focusing on a comprehensive analysis encompassing 161 countries and spanning over the years 2020 to 2050. It aims at explaining the economic impacts of overweight and obesity in monetary terms and on a global scale to provide valuable insights that can inform policy decisions and interventions.


Despite growing recognition of the health implications of overweight and obesity, the economic dimensions of this issue have received comparatively less attention. Understanding the economic costs associated with overweight and obesity is crucial for informing policy decisions, resource allocation, and intervention strategies aimed at mitigating its impact. By shedding light on the economic burden of overweight and obesity, this research seeks to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this complex issue and pave the way for effective public health interventions.
